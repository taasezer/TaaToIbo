- Environments: .env.local

  Creating an optimized production build ...
Ô¿» ERROR: This build i
s using Turbopack, with
 a `webpack` config and
 no `turbopack` config.
   This may be a mistak
e.

   As of Next.js 16 Tur
bopack is enabled by de
fault and
   custom webpack confi
gurations may need to b
e migrated to Turbopack
.

   NOTE: your `webpack`
 config may have been a
dded by a configuration
 plugin.

   To configure Turbopa
ck, see https://nextjs.

   TIP: Many applicatio
ns work fine under Turb
opack with no configura
tion,
   if that is the case 
for you, you can silenc
e this error by passing
 the
   `--turbopack` or `--
webpack` flag explicitl
y or simply setting an 
   empty turbopack conf
ig in your Next config 
file (e.g. `turbopack: 
{}`).
